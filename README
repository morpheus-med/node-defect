This program reads in anonymized data, sends it in random-sized chunks over a socket, and
pipes it to gzip. After 1-2 runs, node crashes with a core dump.
The format of the data is 1 byte or 4 bytes indicating the size of the upcoming data, followed by nuls.

To reproduce the issue, run

unzip anonymized-data.zip
node index.js

You should get an Aborted (core dumped) in 1-2 tries.
